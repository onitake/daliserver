.Sh BUGS
Probably a lot. The communication protocol was reverse engineered by
running the adapter's Windows software in a virtual machine and analyzing
the data that was transmitted on the USB bus. The DALI standard is not
publicly available either, so all the info on the DALI protocol was
extracted from some microcontroller example code documentation and the USB
dumps.
